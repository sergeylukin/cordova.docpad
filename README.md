# A Hello World [DocPad](http://docpad.org) project ready for Cordova deploy

The application is based on the [Apache Cordova Hello World][cordova-app] app.

## Usage

### Run Application

    /www/index.html

### PhoneGap/Build

Create a new app with the following repository:

    https://github.com/sergeylukin/cordova.docpad.git

## Developing

- Install Docpad `sudo npm install -g docpad`
- Execute `docpad run`
- Modify files in `src` directory and watch them generated in `www` directory


## TODO

- Currently `www` directory contents is part of repository which makes this
  project ready for immediate deploy and try at any time, however it's not the
  best option from Version Control System point of view so it would be nice to
  find a better option
